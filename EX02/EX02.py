        Logic:
            - This function uses the Lidar range readings to determine the current state
            of the robot in terms of distance to obstacle directly in front of it.
            - The state is assigned based on the following conditions:
                - Very Far: If the range is greater than or equal to 1.5 meters.
                - Far: If the range is between (inclusive) 1.0 and 1.5 meters.
                - Near: If the range is between (inclusive) 0.7 and 1.0 meters.
                - Close: If the range is less than 0.7 meters.
            - If no new measurement is available from the Lidar sensor, the function
            will retain the previous state.

        Example:
            If the Lidar front facing reading returns a distance of 0.65 meters,
            the robot's state will be "close". If the distance is 1.2 meters, the state
            will be "far".

        Note:
            You will have to determine and extract the Lidars front facing direction
            measurement from the Lidar sensor
            readings.

        Returns:
